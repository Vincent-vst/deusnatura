## About 

Deus Natura is a collection of music exercices I have encountered while applying to different universities and conservatories.   
It consists of five main modules :   
- *ear training* : An interval identification exercice. 
- *repeat* : Hear and repeat a melody/sample
- *theory* : A bunch of music theory questions
- *improvisation* : A random backing track player   
- *sight reading* : Display a random score

## Build and deploy
