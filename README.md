## About

Deus Natura is a collection of music exercices I have encountered while applying to different universities and conservatories.  
It consists of five main modules :

- _ear training_ : An interval identification exercice.
- _repeat_ : Hear and repeat a melody/sample
- _theory_ : A bunch of music theory questions
- _improvisation_ : A random backing track player
- _sight reading_ : Display a random score

## Docs

The docs are published on my [notion](https://vincentdescatoire.notion.site/Documentation-and-bug-report-bbc7d42576684a61b1d2f75c4bfa0b7f).
